# 3D-Image-Rotate-Effect-on-Mouse-Hover-Using-CSS-And-JavaScript
This project demonstrates how to create a 3D image rotation effect that responds to mouse hover using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. When the user hovers over the image, it rotates along the X and Y axes, creating a smooth, dynamic 3D effect.
